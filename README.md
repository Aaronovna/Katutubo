Katutubo is a platform designed for customers who appreciate and love indigenous artists' crafts and arts. In this challenging times where Indigenous communities lack access to good healthcare and lack of food, We made our mission to support the indigenous people who strive to find livelihood through their crafts and art by providing a platform to share their breathtaking and beautiful works with the rest of the world.
